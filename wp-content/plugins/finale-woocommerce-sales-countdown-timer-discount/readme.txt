Finale lets you create scheduled one time or recurring campaigns. It induces urgency with visual elements such as Countdown Timer and Counter Bar to motivate users to place an order.

== Description ==

[Finale](https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&utm_campaign=wp-repo&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=Finale) is the ONLY WooCommerce plugin that allows you to create urgency and scarcity inducing promotional campaigns.

You can use Finale to run scheduled sales campaigns such as flash sales, seasonal promotions, coupon code led discounts, pre-launch offers, daily deals, faster shipping deadline campaigns, instant discounts, early bird deals, recurring offers and more.

Finale is built to empower store owners who want to run promotions and convert more visitors into buyers. It's for those who don't believe in 'let's hope they'll buy someday' philosophy. Instead want to seize every opportunity to generate more orders.

> "This plugin is everything I was looking for and more. The best part is that all the settings are intuitive- I didn't have to spend hours figuring things out. I could get started within minutes of installation. And yes, a big thumbs up for support, they ensure you win with the plugin."

== Finale's Lite Features ==

1. **[Set Up Sales Between Two Fixed Dates and Time](https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&utm_campaign=wp-repo&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=Main)**
In WooCommerce you cannot start a campaign at a set time. But Finale allows you to pick a time. This is great for running flash sales like happy hours, deals of the day (Wow Wednesdays, Tipsy Thursdays), prime time specials, lunch hour deals and more.


2. **[Run a Countdown Timer to Give Shoppers a Clear Deadline for Action](https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&utm_campaign=wp-repo&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=Main)**
Most shoppers wait until the last few hours to make their purchase. In fact a typical sales graph shows that 90% of sales happen on the big last day. It's when the fear of missing out is at its peak. Make this insight into buyer psyche work in your favor.
Use Finale to set up stunning countdown timers on the product page to remind shoppers about the deadline. You'll be surprised by the power of a subtle reminder.

3.  **[Set up a counter bar to show the real-time stock status ](https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&utm_campaign=wp-repo&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=Main)**
Visualization is powerful. Don't tell your visitors the number of items left in stock, show them. A counter bar shows the real time stock status and gives people a compelling reason to hurry up. It's persuasive and moves as more and more people buy. Similar to Amazon's counter bar on daily deals that says 'x% of deal claimed', it gives you the power to use scarcity with class!

4.  **[Create rules to customize campaigns](https://xlplugins.com/finale-woocommerce-sales-countdown-timer-discount-plugin/?utm_source=finale-lite&utm_campaign=wp-repo&utm_medium=readme&utm_term=Main)**
Rule builder allows you to create your rules to customize campaigns. It makes the experience of using Finale hassle-free. No need to visit individual product pages to set up campaigns. Choose from 4 nifty rules to customize your campaigns. Set up campaigns: On certain hand-picked products, or all products in a specified product category, or chosen product type or only on products under or above a certain price point.




== Finale: The Must Have Tool For Running Scarcity & Urgency Led Promotions At Any Time of The Year ==

**Set up your deals of the day, clearance sales, end-of-season offers, early bird discounts, members-only offers, and festive campaigns in minutes.**

> "Finale is a game changer. It's one of the most effective sales-booster I've ever tried! It's amazing how easy is to manage sales and display triggers that motivate customers to purchase more and come back to the store. Different sets of conditions and types of rules lead to impressive results. The outcome is almost unbelievable! Also the support is outstanding... Thanks, Daman you did a great job!"

* Having the controls to plan and set up your promotional calendars in one go

= Who should use Finale? =

* Ambitious store owners committed to driving more revenue to their business this season.
* Store owners tired of letting interested shoppers leave their site and postponing their purchase decision
* Store owners who're ready to generate more cash from the same traffic without spending a dime more on ads
* Those who understand the importance of shopper psychology in sales

**If this is you, you're the right fit for Finale.**

= Think About This =

**Would you ever make it to the airport on time if flights didn't have a set departure time?**

No. We speed our car, grab coffee on the way and do whatever it takes to make it on time.

Why? Because there is a definite deadline attached to the task.

We experience fear of missing out and fear of losing money on the tickets. This propels us into fast action.

Similarly deadline-based campaigns and stock scarcity make people experience fear of missing out.

This acts against their natural procrastination and nudges them to the finish line.

== Why We Built Finale? ==

Most store owners run campaigns. But they are ineffective without awareness and definitive expiry deadline.

We [studied several top stores](https://xlplugins.com/woocommerce-discounts-deals/) to see what they were doing to clock high conversion rates.

And discovered they had the master key to sales i.e. shopper psychology nailed.

Here is what Top store owners do to increase conversions:

* Run Time-bound flash sales
* Introduce Limited-edition products
* Announce Exclusive deals of the day and weekend offers
* Build hype around new launches
* Create awareness around festive campaigns through visual elements on the store
* Put up a faster shipment deadline.

These well-planned campaigns help them set high sales records. We wanted to bring the same [bag o' nifty conversion hacks](https://xlplugins.com/woocommerce-discounts-deals/) to small WooCommerce store owners.

And that's what led to Finale.

Also, store owners like you told us they wanted us to build a plugin that could help them run recurring campaigns.

They found it a tedious task to go back to the admin panel to re-start campaigns.

These demands solidified the core features of Finale.
