Marquee image crawler is a continuous scrolling image plugin. This plugin crawls the images left or right.

== Description ==

Marquee image crawler is a continuous scrolling image plugin. This plugin crawls the images left or right. Instead of automatic scrolling, image can optionally be mouse driven, so the location of the mouse cursor dictates which direction for the image crawl to go and at what speed of the crawl. In the plugin admin, we have the option to add and upload the images. In the short code we have the option to configure the crawler speed and image crawler gallery size.
